potential issue: onBoot equals execute shellscript; disconnect from server while editing and crashing edit session(nvim: external editor, explain details); stuck on "boot loot"; 

I modified the .replit file to run a shellscript when the repl boots up: 
    onBoot = ["./startup.sh"]
If I lose connection with the server while editing the shellscript in an external editor (neovim) in the terminal/shell, the repl stops functioning. Attempting to open the repl will result in the repl not loading; the console prints "Booting Repl" and a red error message at the bottom right prints "Failed to connect, retrying". 
When neovim crashes with unsaved changes, usually, a pop-up appears the next time neovim is opened, inquiring what action to perform with the found swap file. 
Perhaps the repl not loading past the "Booting repl" sequence is due to neovim preventing the shellscript from being run, due to the error. Seems odd that a text editor would prevent a shellscript from being executed due to a swap file found with unsaved changes, but maybe I'm wrong

The shellscript runs a command to install a vim extention called vim-plug, but that may be irrelevant.
